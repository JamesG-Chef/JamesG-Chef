### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James.

In what is starting to feel like a long time ago, I was a chef.

Now i've put down my knives, picked up my laptop and swapped writing recipes for writing lines of code. 

Which is harder...? I'm still not quite sure.

I started to dabble more seriously in writing code during the lockdown of 2020.

In 2021 I realised I needed to level up the commitment if it was ever going to get real.
I'm now a recent graduate of the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp where I learnt the fundamentals of Javascript both on the front end and the back.

Now I'm just trying to colsolidate what I've learnt and gain some coding mileage

:boom: I love creating stuff and that's what i intend on doing :boom:

  :tada: :tada: :tada:

I'm hoping this journey will lead me to find my first role in a professional evironment. :four_leaf_clover:

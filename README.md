### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.....
I was a chef.

Now i've swapped writing recipes for writing lines of code. 
Which is harder...? I'm still not quite sure.

I'm a recent graduate of the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp where I learnt the fundamentals of Javascript both on the front end and the back.

:boom: I love the constant challenge and the endless list of things to learn, it keeps me hungry  :boom:

  :tada: :tada: :tada:

Now i'm hoping to find my first role in a professional evironment. :four_leaf_clover:

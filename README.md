### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James.

In what is starting to feel like a long time ago, I was a chef.

Now i've put down my knives, picked up my laptop and swapped recipes for code. 

Which is harder...? I'm still not quite sure.

I started to dabble more seriously in writing code during the lockdown of 2020.

In 2021 I realised I needed to level up the commitment if it was ever going to get real.
I'm a graduate of the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp where I learnt the fundamentals of Javascript both on the front end and the back.

:boom: Now I'm just trying to consolidate what I've learnt and continue my journey into the world of digital literacy :boom:
